                <p>Jimmy here. <br> I am currently a Game Design and Development student from Macquarie University, with a passion for animation, and a deep interest in game design. I've been playing video games since 7 years old on all platforms, even recently
                    getting into Virtual Reality!

                <p>I love experimenting with different types of animations in games, from Frame Animation to 3D, and constantly learning new game animation techniques. I'm proficient in C# and the Unity game engine on the programming side. <br> I also run
                    a gaming YouTube channel ranging from gameplay videos to reviews, although I'm planning to start producing video essays of game design in the future. </p>

description: A 1v2 Card Battle game where 'fighters' - a group of 2 players - must coordinate together to defeat 'Bob' - a solo player.<br> The decks were designed so that Bob would have cards powerful enough to stand against 2 players, while the fighters' decks have strategic cards that can buff themselves or debuff Bob, along with your standard damage cards. The card game is inspired by Yu-gi-oh, and Magic the Gathering. <p> The Bob Card game was desgined by 3 others, with me being the original concept designer of this game.</p> <p><i>Fun Fact - the origin of 'Bob' was from a worldbuilding exercise in a practical class, in which we built a concept world around an angry individual named 'Bob', who would cause mass destruction of the whole village he lives in. We liked our concept so much, we extended it further by turning it into a card game. The rest was history.</i></p>

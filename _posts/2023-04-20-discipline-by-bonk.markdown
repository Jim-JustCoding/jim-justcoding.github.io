description: A "comedic" survival game where you <strong>"bonk"</strong> children to stop them from growing and destroying the whole place. This was developed in a 2-day game jam, with 3 other team members, where the theme was "Micro/Macro", and an added constraint of a 3-colour palette.<br> I was the animator (3D) and music producer/sound designer of this game. <br> <i>(This is actually the first game that I produced music for, considering I am still learning music production)</i> <p> PLAY ON <a href="https://refreshingcucumber.itch.io/discipline-by-bonk" target="_blank">ITCH.IO<i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-itch-io"></i></a></p>

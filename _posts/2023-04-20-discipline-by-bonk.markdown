description:<p> A comedic survival game where you <strong>"bonk"</strong> children to stop them from growing and destroying the whole place. This was developed in a 2-day game jam, with 3 other team members, where the theme was "Micro/Macro", and an added constraint of a 3-colour palette.<br> I was the animator (3D) and music producer/sound designer of this game. <br> <i>(This is actually the first game that I produced music for, considering I was learning music production at the time)</i></p> 

<p> As I knew firsthand that animating the models from scratch will take a long time, and considering that I will make music for this game, I relied on Mixamo to animate the children models and speed up the process. The way they run around the classroom adds to the comedic nature of the game, in my opinion. I also had the idea of turning the bonked children into ragdolls as a way to add feedback to the player when they successfully hit a child, although the ragdoll physics are probably too... exaggerated. </p>

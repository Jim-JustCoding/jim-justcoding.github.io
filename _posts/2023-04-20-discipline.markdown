description: A "comedic" survival game where you <strong>"bonk"</strong> children to stop them from growing and destroying the whole place. This was developed in a 2-day game jam, with 3 other team members, where the theme was "Micro/Macro", with an added constraint of a 3-colour palette.<br> I was the animator and music producer of this game. <br> <i>This is actually the first game where I produced music for, considering I am still learning music production.</i><br> Play on <a href="https://refreshingcucumber.itch.io/discipline-by-bonk" target="_blank">Itch.io</a>.

description: A short VR experience designed to energise players by dodging thrown food and shooting back at them. This was created and published on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3158342884265828/" target="_blank">Liminal Platform</a> in 5 months. I was the animator and QA Tester for the project (the only person on the team who owns a Meta Quest 2 headset).

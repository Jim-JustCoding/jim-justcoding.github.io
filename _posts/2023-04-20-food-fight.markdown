description: <p>A short VR experience designed to energise players by dodging thrown food and shooting back at them. With assistance from Liminal VR, this was created and published on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3158342884265828/" target="_blank">Liminal Platform</a> in 5 months, in a team of 6.<br> I was the animator (3D) and QA Tester for the project.</p><p> This was the first project where I learnt how to use Blender and Mixamo to animate the characters in Unity. While I got all the animation states I planned for implemented, I felt like there is a much better pipeline process for game animation. To be fair, I only had a short time to know how Blender and Unity can work together.</p> <p> The team involves me as animator and QA, two software engineers, two artists, and two level designers, with some of my team members fulfilling multiple roles. As I was the only team member who owns a Meta Quest 2 headset, most of my time was testing new features implemented by the team. In fact, the game was originally going to feature a togglable shield that the player can use to block food. Not only we could not figure out the scale of the object correctly in the VR space, and get the controls working correctly, but we found that it defeated the purpose of an energising VR experience - we want the player to be moving constantly. We scrapped it and instead implemented two-handed food cannons.</p> <p>Check out Liminal's release post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/liminal-vr_energy-liminalplatform-virtualreality-activity-7010819503362109440-nEMh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">LinkedIn <i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-linkedin"></i></a></p>

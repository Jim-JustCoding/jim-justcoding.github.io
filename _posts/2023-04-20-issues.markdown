description: <p> A 2D platformer with a comic aesthetic. The concept of this game was inspired by superhero comics, and games like the <i>The Henry Stickmin Collection</i> (a choose-your-own-adventure game) and <i>FRAMED</i> (a puzzle game set in an animated comic book).<br> <i>Issues</i> was developed by a team of 4, with me being the animator (2D Frame), and Lead Playtester of the project.</p> <p> The project was meant to represent a vertical slice of our game concept, and then further develop and polish in a later semester. As such, we focused more on the gameplay mechanics rather than the visuals. Still, I had the idea of frame animating the player stickman, after being inspired by various stickman animation videos on YouTube. I utilised Adobe Animate and Unity's 2D animation tools as my pipeline of this game.</p> <p> At the time, I was still getting familiar with Unity C#, and I was responsible for implementing the animation system. I learnt how to use the Unity animator to control the animation states, and trigger events at a certain keyframe of an animation.</p> <p>PLAY ON <a href="https://scara2016.itch.io/issues-demo" target="_blank">ITCH.IO<i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-itch-io"></i></a></p>

description: <p>A point-and-click murder mystery game set in a mansion, and playing as a Detective solving the case. Developed with 3 others within 4 months, Red Handed is now available on <a href="https://bazzagibbs.itch.io/red-handed" target="_blank">Itch.io.<i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-itch-io"></i></a><br> I was the animator (2D Tween) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedHandedGame" target="_blank">marketing/social media manager <i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-youtube"></i></a> of the game, where I produced devlogs during our game's development for our YouTube channel, YouTube shorts to promote the game, and engage our small audience on Twitter.</p>

<p> This project was a unique university project, in that we basically had to start from scratch, when we are supposed to continue from a project done in a past semester. We had to carefully plan what we had to do in our weekly scrum meetings, and ensure our work is done according to schedule. Again, we only had 4 months to present this project by the end of the semester.</p>

<p> I took the first 3 weeks of the project to learn how to do tween animation using Unity's animator. I was aware of other alternatives I could have used, but they were either outdated, or may require more time learning in. I used some sample sprites provided by Unity and practiced rigging sprites for tweening, while the rest of the team were figuring out Yarn Spinner - our narrative engine of choice, and rapidly prototyping gameplay interaction.</p>

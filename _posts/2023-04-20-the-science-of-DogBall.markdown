description: <p>Inspired by a high school games project that was made in a web game creator, The Science of DogBall is a 2D infinite scroller experimenting with physics and magnetic forces. This was developed in a 2-day game jam, and this game marks the first game I have developed solo - along with my brother volunteering his time helping with the art and music. The theme of this game jam was "Magnets", and an added constraint of a 'stationery' camera.</p> 

<p>When the theme of the game jam was announced, the first thing that instantly came into my mind was Sonic the Hedgehog's Homing Attack move. The Homing Attack involves Sonic locking onto a target, curling himself into a ball and rushing at the enemy at speed. While I could not quite figure out how to replicate the homing attack move into Unity, Sonic was in fact the main inspiration behind the mechanics of this game.</p>

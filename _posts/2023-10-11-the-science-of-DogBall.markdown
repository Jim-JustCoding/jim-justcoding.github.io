description: <p>Inspired by a high school games project that was made in a web game creator, The Science of DogBall is a 2D infinite scroller experimenting with physics and magnetic forces. This was developed in a 2-day game jam, and this game marks the first game I have developed solo - along with my brother volunteering his time helping with the art and music. The theme of this game jam was "Magnets", and an added constraint of a 'stationery' camera.</p> <p> PLAY ON <a href="https://jim-justgaming.itch.io/the-science-of-dog-ball" target="_blank">ITCH.IO<i class="fa-brands fa-fw fa-itch-io"></i></a></p>
